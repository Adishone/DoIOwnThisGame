# Do I Own This Game
This is a repository for Do I Own This Game browser addon.

## Description
Have you ever came to a situation that there's multiple games in bundles on Humble Bundle, but you are not sure if you don't owe them already? This addon is supposed to help you.

## Works on:
1. Humble Bundle
2. Fanatical
3. Indie Gala
4. Oculus Quest Store Sections

## Known issues
1. If you own a normal non VR version of the game in your steam library and there's a VR version of this game with the same name it will show-up in Oculus Quest Store as owned one. Example: Resident Evil 4. 
2. Humble Bundle forgot to add "!" at the end of Acron: Attack of the Squirrels title so it shows as not owned. Humble Bundle should fix it on their side.

## Usage
Addon should load automatically on mentioned websites, but in case of any problems, reload button was introduced in addon menu from version 1.2. It is pretty handy in cases when you can't see full list of games at the start, because of infinite scrolling for example.

## I would like to make it also work on this site
Please open an issue on github with link to the site that you would like to get added
