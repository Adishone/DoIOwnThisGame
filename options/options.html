      <h4>What is GoG Galaxy and how do I get it?</h4>
      GOG Galaxy 2.0 is a wonderful concept of a PC games launcher that puts all
      your favourite games in one place. It's essentially a single library for
      all your games from Steam, Origin, UPlay and Epic Store, as well as games
      from GOG.com (naturally). Various integrations in GOG Galaxy 2.0 mean it
      works with 20 gaming platforms currently. To get it go to
      <a
        href="https://www.gog.com/galaxy"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >GoG Galaxy Site</a
      >

      <h4>Where do I find GoG Galaxy Database?</h4>
      If you are using MAC, default database location will be
      /Users/Shared/GOG.com/Galaxy/Storage/galaxy-2.0.db <br />
      If you are using Windows, default database location will be
      C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db <br />
      ProgramData is hidden folder, so you can have problems with finding it on
      your disk.

      <h4>How to get CSV file with my games?</h4>
      In Playnite you would need addon to export your games list to CSV:
      https://playnite.link/addons.html#LibraryExporter_54bf64c6-c453-4cbc-92f8-4960b56f930e
      Uncheck all fields when exporting as only names are needed.

      <h4>
        Do I need to update this extenstion with newer version of database/csv
        file?
      </h4>
      Yes, you do. Below this paragraph you will find information when last
      update happened, if that happened long time ago please reupload your
      database/csv file. For security reason this step can't be automated.
