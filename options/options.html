      <h4>What is GoG Galaxy and how do I get it?</h4>
      GOG Galaxy 2.0 is a wonderful concept of a PC games launcher that puts all your favourite games in one place.

      It's essentially a single library for all your games from Steam, Origin, UPlay and Epic Store, as well as games from GOG.com (naturally). 
      Various integrations in GOG Galaxy 2.0 mean it works with 20 gaming platforms currently.

      To get it go to <a href="https://www.gog.com/galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoG Galaxy Site</a>

      <h4>Where do I find GoG Galaxy Database?</h4>
      If you are using MAC, default database location will be /Users/Shared/GOG.com/Galaxy/Storage/galaxy-2.0.db <br />
      If you are using Windows, default database location will be C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db <br />
      ProgramData is hidden folder, so you can have problems with finding it on your disk.

      <h4>Do I need to update this extenstion with newer version of database?</h4>
      Yes, you do. Below this paragraph you will find information when last update happened, if that happened long time ago please reupload your database. 
      For security reason this step can't be automated.
